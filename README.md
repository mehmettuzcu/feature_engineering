Data preprocessing:

Before the machine learning models are established, some corrections made on the data set, completing the missing data, removing duplicate data, transforming, integrating, cleaning, normalizing, size reduction, etc. are transactions. At this stage, inevitably, knowledge discovery is made on the data.

In this notebook, we will perform the necessary steps for data preprocessing before the machine learning modeling of the Titanic dataset.

Business Problem:

Required for a machine learning pipeline data preprocessing and variable engineering script needs to be prepared. When the dataset is passed through this script, the modeling starts expected to be ready.

Dataset Story: 

The data set of the people who were in the Titanic shipwreck.It consists of 768 observations and 12 variables.The target variable is specified as "Survived";

1: one's survival,
0: indicates that the person did not survive


Variable Description:

1-) PassengerId: Unique id number to each passenger
2-) Survived: Passenger survived(1) or died(0)
3-) Pclass: Passenger class
4-) Name: Name
5-) Sex: Gender of passenger
6-) Age: Age of passenger
7-) SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses
8-) Parch: Number of parents/children
9-) Ticket: Ticket number
10-) Fare: Amount of money spent on ticket
11-) Cabin: Cabin category
12-) Embarked: Port where passenger embarked (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
